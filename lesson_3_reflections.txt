Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work

A: When you wanted to collaborate with others on a project or share your code for others to use. It also serves as a backup to your local files.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: You may have commits that have not been pushed to the remote repository yet. Pulling might overwrite some local commits.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A: Forks are like clones on GitHub. Use them when you want to copy an existing GitHub repository to your own. Clones are copies on our local machine. Use them when you want to copy the code but don't intend to share it with others. Branches are separate paths of development used to create new features or experiment with ideas.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

A: It allows the local repository to know if it is out of sync with the remote. By knowing the last known state, git will know if changes have been made to both local and remote copies. It will know at what point it will need to merge the commits.
